#Logistic-Regression-Model

This repository contains a simple implementation of Logistic Regression using Python and essential machine learning libraries. It is designed as a beginner-level project to demonstrate the basic workflow of training a classification model.

## 📌 Project Overview

Logistic Regression is a fundamental classification algorithm used to predict categorical outcomes. In this project, I’ve built and evaluated a logistic regression model using popular Python libraries such as:

- **NumPy** – for numerical operations  
- **pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** – for data visualization  
- **scikit-learn (sklearn)** – for model building, training, and evaluation  

## 🛠️ Features

- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Model training using Logistic Regression  
- Accuracy evaluation  
- Visualization of results  
- ✅ **Deployable for real-time predictions**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
python >= 3.7
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

This project is structured to be deployable for real-world applications. The trained model can be easily integrated into a web service using:

Flask or FastAPI for API development

Docker for containerization
